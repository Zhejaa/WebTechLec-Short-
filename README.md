Years before the mass media technology was invented where people going out without their cell phone, or watching the news in the morning before going out, wherein, we gain information only in newspapers and radio which was been published from the past days. But what will happen in our current event and upcoming events that will occur to us especially when it comes to weather updates, casualties, and other places that has ongoing events. Now a day, people use their phones to get updates about what is going on in the world today. Anywhere they are going, they just open the application on their phones or application market to gain information about current events and or upcoming events that will occur. That’s why, people now a day knows what the current event was going on and people know where or when to get ready when danger occurred or to evacuate themselves when it comes to calamities and typhoons because our mass media today are always updated (i.e. past, present, future).  All in all, based from experience, we know that having mass media gives us a stability day to day activities.


What would happen to our world if people lost their communication? i.e. no cell phones, no internet, fax mail, and others, maybe all of us need to go to the person just to give the information we want to tell, or maybe until now, we are still using a sender/receiver person like in world war, or using an eagle or bird to send a letter to the person we want to received. All in all, we need to create whole letter so that, in return, they will reply the letter that what we need to talk about it. And just like in world war, we need to create our own language so that, nobody will intercept the information that was been rendered or only the two of you only knows what the information is talking about. And back to our sender person and eagle, what will happen to them if they been killed by the people or by the weather, we don’t know if the letter has been reached to the person we want to receive, and it takes time and days to send the letter to the person we want to received. That’s why, we created a technology to help and ease our communication or to lessen the time sending the information to the person we want to received. We don’t need to create long information, because in a short information, automatically, it is being replied and received in the other side. We can call and chat on the spot when danger is being occurred.
