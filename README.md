What is the world wide web?
In our technology today, world wide web is a system where internationally can see the documents that was been created or uploaded documents and other web resources that can be accessed in the internet. This world wide web helps the people to give them information about our daily activities and updated news that was been published while using our gadgets (i.e. computers, cellphones, tablets, etc.).
What is mass media and communication?
Mass media and communication mostly uses when we send information to the people using our technology or collection of mass media that can reach a large audience via mass communication especially when it comes to our social networks like facebook, twitter, Instagram, etc.
How mass media and communication need the world wide web?
Now a day, people uses their phones to get updates about what is going on in the world today. they just need to open their application on their phones or application market to gain information about the current events and or upcoming events that will occur. That’s why, people now a day knows what the current event was going on, and people know where or when to get ready when danger occurred or to evacuate themselves when it comes to calamities and typhoons because our mass media and communication today are always updated (i.e. past, present, future).  All in all, based from experience, we know that having mass media and communication gives us a stability day to day activities and the needs in the world wide web.

What would happen to our world if people lost their communication? i.e. no cell phones, no internet, fax mail, and others, maybe all of us need to go to the person just to give the information we want to tell, or maybe until now, we are still using a sender/receiver person like in world war, or using an eagle or bird to send a letter to the person we want to received. All in all, we need to create whole letter so that, in return, they will reply the letter that what we need to talk about it. And just like in world war, we need to create our own language so that, nobody will intercept the information that was been rendered or only the two of you only knows what the information is talking about. And back to our sender person and eagle, what will happen to them if they been killed by the people or by the weather, we don’t know if the letter has been reached to the person we want to receive, and it takes time and days to send the letter to the person we want to received. That’s why, we created a technology to help and ease our communication or to lessen the time sending the information to the person we want to received. We don’t need to create long information, because in a short information, automatically, it is being replied and received in the other side. We can call and chat on the spot when danger is being occurred. 

A world without Mass Media and Communication is a lonely world. Countries or just even provinces or regions or states are isolated to each other, foreign from each other and afraid what is the world beyond their places. Isolation regresses or stops a nation to be more progress by not sharing communications from other nation. It keeps them from sharing or receiving information that is essential to a nation. As we can see in our present day, countries are forming unions and gathering allies to become strong and become more powerful. Joining a union or is an ally of a country guaranty some things like safety, and economical help. For example, when another nation attacks an ally nation, the allied nations can call help to aid them from war, or help and support a nation if there is a dispute among other nations. As or economical help allied nations can asked for resources and manpower that they don’t have and send this to the allied nations, other nations can invest on other nations and have an exchange of benefits to each other. This is the help our a good communication, as we can see without communication we are stuck in our own world, not be able to expand our knowledge and awareness, not be able to help others when they are in danger or needed help, not be able to express yourself in to the world and not be able to reach out to the persons you love.
